        ansPara:" There is no controlled study to prove how long coronavirus antibodies exist in our system after an infection. Thus, there is a chance for you to get infected again if exposed to the virus."

        ansPara:" The pores in common masks are not small enough to stop a virus. Thus, the best precaution is to stay home and to wash hands as frequently as possible."

        choiceA :"True",

        ansPara:"There is no evidence to suggest this. Coronavirus spreads through surface contact and not through food. "

        choiceA :"True",
        choiceB :"False",
