			<h3><center>Covid Response Operations for Guided Outcomes</center></h3><br><br>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="lead">Project CoronaGo aims to achieve a targeted controlled mitigation of the rate of spread of COVID-19 infection by implementing diverse approaches such as-<br /> 
              1. Design and deployment of a dedicated website, called "The Covidinator" for: <br />
              a. Easy online triaging of patients based on medical history and risk factors. </br>
              b. Increasing awareness in local communities by using interesting tools such as multilingual interactive quizzes on important topics such as sanitation, general protection, and apprehension of Covid symptoms. Thus, creating a community that well informed and safer. </br>
              c. Providing verified and reliable sources of information about Covid-19. <br />
              2. Ideating and deploying a tested streamlined workflow design for swift production of superior quality cloth-masks and other protective equipment using readily available materials and simple assembly training. Also, providing a very simple sterilization method of used masks at home using simple autoclave construction using pressure cooker. <br />
              3. Deployment of advanced strategies in hospital environments and other high-risk enclosures using guided airflow to create stronger containment units. Planned use sanitation gates and of Positive and Negative pressure zones in the hospital for controlling droplet spread and thus greatly reducing the risk of contact of the virus with the hospital staff.<br />

            </h2>
            <p class="lead hide-on-small">Through this online self assesment tool we intend to categorize incoming patients in two categories. To reduce contact between the patients afflicted from Corona and the other patients, we propose a system to divide the hospital's OPD in two zones ,namely 'Red' and 'Green'.Both zones will have seperate entry points. Sanitization gates will be provided for 'Red' zones. Masks are mandatory in both zones. The lobbies of 'Red' zone are to have a refined AIRFLOW mechanism as described in the third part of this project. High grade PPEs are present with the staff in the 'Red' zone. Patients are required to take this online self assessment test to determine which zone they are supposed to use.This tool is not intented to provide a medical diagnosis.Call a nearest Hospital in case of emergency symptoms.</p>
